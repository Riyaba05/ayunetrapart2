              I know how tricky it is to pick the perfect school for our little
              ones. It's like trying to find the best ice cream flavor—everyone
              has a favorite, but what really matters is what makes our kids
              light up. So, let's chat about why picking a school with heart &
              brain, not just fancy words, is so important.

              Here are some key data points to examine for potential schools:
            </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b> Quality of education provided by schools</b> -How well the
            teachers are explaining the concept. In how much depth the teacher
            know the concepts.It is most overlooked but most important part of
            the education.because a good teacher is a person who fosters the
            growth and interest of a child.If you don't have standards like
            virat kohli and M.S Dhoni you would never have interest in cricket
            as same as that if teacher is not good in explaining the concepts
            just reads out the theories than how the hell the child is going to
            underestand & have the interest in studies. if they are unable to
            develop interest in that subject ,NO matter what! they are not going
            to succeed in that field.Either it is science maths or Arts. you can
            visit the quality of education of diffrent schools by visiting

              <b>Experience and expertise of a teacher </b> -In today's business
              world many people are opening schools and coaching classes just
              for the sake of money. They don't have any experience in the
              teaching field. They don't know how to teach a child. They don't
              know how to develop interest, so it is the second most important
              thing. to know the experience and expertise of a Teacher.
